# Automated Enterprise Architecture
This combination of a Python program and an Excel Spreadsheet
is designed to take the software package names and versions
from BigFix, sort them, count them and align the software first
with an augmented form of the Federal Enterprise Architecture
Framework (FEAF) and then with the categories of the TBM Framework.

The Python program has been tested using Python 2.7 to 3.9

Please refer to the PowerPoint for a description with images
and to the Procedures.txt for instructions.

The Python program has been written for utter simplicity
so that non-programmers can follow it.
